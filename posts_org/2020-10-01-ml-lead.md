# Update: ML Lead

This is a quick update on why I stopped posting different projects on this page. For the last year, I have been leading the ML team, organizing the Advanced Computer Vision meetup and helped to co-found (and then leave) a startup in Berlin. With all this, I had no time to work on anything else, including this page and side projects as I always do. 



During this time as ML Lead, I had countless calls with our team, with different stakeholders, investors, C-level executives, etc. . During this time I got to discuss many different approaches to improve the product, learn from my team's experience, review many projects, meet many people and interview many others, solve innumerable issues and avoid the ones we could. In general, I got to improve a big range of skills in order to lead the team as good as I could.



My main goals were data, data and data, apart from that, I always tried to move the product forward, achieve the short-term deadlines by taking approaches that will help our ML stack in the long run. I had many other goals and things, like rely on self-supervision, improve internal processes to serve our models, metrics, release new versions, etc., etc, but let's keep it short.



During this time I had a full calendar every week and calendar events in every corner, it was very insighful but my work-life balance was far from the best, I was not able to do projects, read, and work on my own stuff as much as I would have liked to. In summary: It was an extremely nice experience! I am happy I had the opportunity but I am also happy I don't have meetings anymore so I can fully focus on deep technical problems as before. For now I will be just Principal ML engineer.
