# International Motor Show (IAA 2021)

![main](/img/posts/iaa/bmw.gif)



Last September we had the opportunity to showcase our system in the International Motor Show (IAA), "the world's largest mobility show" (wiki), next to brands like Bosch, Uniky and Valeo. Incredible experience where we were the only AVP (Automated Valet Parking) providers who drove all car brands present in the demo. We worked next to and drove autonomously a Mercedes EQs, Mercedes S class, Jaguar Cugga, VW id.4, Ford Fugg and BMW something.

Amazing experience to be backstage helping make sure all the shows run without issues from the ML perception side of things. A gigantic plus was being able to see a lot of the efforts and goals I focused on while I lead the team paying off in that exact moment. Seeing all the effort from the team and how everything worked out perfectly (mostly) was a great perk of all the months of work and preparation.





The following are some videos showing some of the action of the shows.





### Safety stop

One of my favourite things is watching the car execute an emergency stop, in these videos or crazy CEO Stefan Jenzowsky loves jumping in front of the car to show this feature life.

### Longer segment videos

Just to show a slightly longer video of the choreography of different brands being driven together autonomously at the same time.

### Multiple cars choreography

This is very interesting to showcase the capabilities of the Kopernikus AVP system.

### Passenger seat perspective

This shows how it looks like from the inside of the cars during the show. FYI all autonomous driving in IAA was done with zero humans inside the car.
