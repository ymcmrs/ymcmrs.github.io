Dr Yunmeng Cao is a satellite-geodesy scientist, working in the Geodynamics unit, [GNS Science - Te Pū Ao](https://www.gns.cri.nz/), New Zealand.

As a geodetic scientist, Yunmeng's work focusses on using [satellite radar technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometric_synthetic-aperture_radar) to detect Earth surface’s displacements that are associated with a wide range of geophysical and geotechnical processes, such as seismic- and volcanic-activities, earthquake- and climate-induced landslides, underground resource extraction caused surface movements, and infrastructure damages. 

His research explores advanced approaches to improve satellite geodesy for better geoscience applications. He presents a series of novel methods to model and correct InSAR atmospheric delays, and he develops a couple of [open-source toolboxes](https://github.com/ymcmrs) to process InSAR data precisely, automatically, and rapidly, that are used across the satellite geodesy community. Now at GNS Science, he participates a series of natural hazards projects that supported by New Zealand government, and to better study nationwide landslide hazards, he proposes a new phase-gradient-based InSAR time-series approach to detect local landslides signals over large areas even with strong background signals and errors, which helps us to identify and forecast upcoming hazardous landslides. His research accelerates our resilience to natural hazards.
