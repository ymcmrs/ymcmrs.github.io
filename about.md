Welcome to my personal hub!

My name is Yunmeng Cao (Cao Y.) and I am currently a satellite-geodesy scientist, working in the Geodynamics unit, [GNS Science - Te Pū Ao](https://www.gns.cri.nz/), Aotearoa New Zealand.

My work focusses on using [satellite radar technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometric_synthetic-aperture_radar) to detect Earth surface’s displacements that are associated with a wide range of geophysical and geotechnical processes, such as seismic- and volcanic-activities, earthquake- and climate-induced landslides, underground resource extraction caused surface movements, infrastructure damages, and natural hazards caused surface changes. 

My research explores advanced approaches to improve satellite geodesy for better geoscience applications. I present a series of novel methods to model and correct InSAR atmospheric delays, and I develop a couple of [open-source toolboxes](https://github.com/ymcmrs) for processing InSAR data precisely, automatically, and rapidly, that are used across the satellite geodesy community. Now at GNS Science, I participate a series of natural hazards projects that supported by New Zealand government, and one of my latest project is to identify nationwide upcoming hazardous landslides using both radar and optical satellite images. I propose a new phase-gradient-based InSAR time-series approach to detect local landslides signals over large areas even with strong background signals and errors, which helps us to identify and forecast upcoming hazardous landslides, and thus accelerates our resilience to natural hazards.
