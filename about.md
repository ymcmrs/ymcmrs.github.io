#### Welcome to my personal hub!
 
 
My name is Yunmeng Cao (曹云梦). I am a professor of [Satellite Geodesy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_geodesy) based at School of Geoscience and Info-physics in [Central South University](https://en.csu.edu.cn/), Changsha, China.

Our team focusses on using [satellite radar technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometric_synthetic-aperture_radar) to detect, analyze, and model Earth surface's spatio-temporal changes that are associated with a wide range of geophysical and geotechnical processes, such as seismic- and volcanic-activities, earthquake- and climate-induced landslides, underground resource extraction caused surface movements, infrastructure damages, and natural hazards caused surface changes.  

We develop state-of-the-art algorithms to improve satellite geodesy for better geoscience applications, and have developed a couple of [open-source toolboxes](https://github.com/ymcmrs) aiming to process satellite geodesy data more precisely, quickly, and automatically, based on modern adjustment theory, geostatistic, and artificial intelligence. Our group's long-term goal is to intelligently and rapidly detect Earth surface's changes/displacements using Earth observation (EO) responding to climate change caused geohazards, geophysical activities, and sudden natural hazards over large areas (e.g., nation wide).
